            description: "Traditional water heaters are the most common type of water heater. They work by storing hot water in a tank and then distributing it throughout the house as needed. These tanks can hold anywhere from 20 to 80 gallons of water, depending on the size of the household.\n" +
                "One of the benefits of traditional water heaters is that they are relatively inexpensive to install. They are also reliable and can last up to 10 to 15 years with proper maintenance. However, they do have some drawbacks.",

            title: "Tankless Water Heaters",
            description: "Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular in households due to their energy efficiency and space-saving design. Rather than storing hot water in a tank, tankless water heaters heat the water on-demand as it is needed. This means they only use energy when hot water is being used, making them more energy-efficient.\n" +
                "One of the benefits of tankless water heaters is that they take up less space than traditional water heaters. They are also more energy-efficient, which means lower energy bills in the long run. However, they do have some drawbacks. They can be more expensive to install initially and may not be able to keep up with the high demand for hot water in larger households.",
